# Transistors

## Darlington Transistor
A multi-transistor configuration called the Darlington configuration is made by two bipolar transistors connected in such a way that the current amplified by the first transistor is amplified further by the second one. This configuration gives a much higher current gain than each transistor taken separately:

It is critical to put a current limiting resistor at the base to protect the transistor from pulling too much current.
